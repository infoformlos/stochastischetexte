# This is a python-version of "Stochastische Texte" by Theo Lutz from 1959. 
# It uses a script by Nick Montfort (https://nickm.com/memslam/stochastic_texts.html) 
# but reimplements the original german words used also by Lutz (taken from Franz Kafka "Das Schloss")
# also it adds a correction for german flexions using a dictioary and list comprehension.
