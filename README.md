# "Stochastic Texts" 
## Re-implementation of a program by Theo Lutz from 1959
This script takes code from Nick Montfort (https://nickm.com/memslam/stochastic_texts.html) and reimplements the original german words used  by Theo Lutz in what was once regarded the first work of digital literature (taken from Franz Kafka "Das Schloss". Also I added a correction for german flexions using a dictioary and list comprehension.
